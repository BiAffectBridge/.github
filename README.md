# BiAffectBridge

This is a shared organization to allow changing any endpoints or customization needed by the BiAffect organization. For now, this is a separate organization to allow for ex-employees of Sage Bionetworks to have read/write priviledges to allow them to create forks. Eventually, this organization will be transfered to the BiAffect project or the repos will be transfered to the main organization.
